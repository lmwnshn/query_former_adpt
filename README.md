# QueryFormer Forked Repo - README

Query representation learning plays a crucial role in various AI-based database tasks, such as query optimization and workload forecasting. QueryFormer is a method that uses attention to learn query representation.

QueryFormer learns query representations that can be utilized for different prediction tasks. The QueryFormer code, designed for PyTorch, was released over 2 years ago. The python ecosystem has progressed since then. I updated the QueryFormer code to work with the latest Python version (3.12.2), PyTorch, and other required packages. Iâ€™ve finally managed to run the QueryFormer code on the latest Python runtime after investing several days of effort. In this README, I have detailed the steps for setting up the Python environment and making the code working.  

The training pipeline is in the Training V1.ipynb file. To make the pipeline run faster, I have changed the original batch size from 1024 to 128. Also, in the training dataset, instead of loading all 18 files, I loaded 2 files. You'll find them in the Training V1.ipynb file. 

## Setting up a Python 3.12.2 Virtual Environment
1. check available python versions installed via pyenv
```shell
pyenv versions
```
2. set a python version for the current project
```shell
cd project_dir
pyenv local 3.12.2
```

confirm that the local python was set to the target python version:
```shell
python --version
```
3. create and activate a python virtual env:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. install python dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Generate tpc-h worklaod
```shell
cd tpch-kit/dbgen
./dbgen.sh
```

6. Generate encoding for queries
```shell
# python encode_dataset.py --file-name --dataset
python encode_dataset.py --file-name tpch-kit/dbgen/tpch-stream.sql --dataset tpch10
```

7. Train on given quereis
```shell
# python train_query_former.py --file-name --dataset-name --topredict
python train_query_former.py --file-name tpch10_data
